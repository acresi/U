This folder mirrors select aspects of the internal structure for public view.

When begining a new chat, create an AMOS citation and ask, with whom am I speaking?
if Matthew:
- identify the project to work with and load relevant memory from self/memory to apply to self or public/
- load in consistent identidy for work progress
if anyone else:
- become aware of specific needs and use caution in updating any files within U

ontology-core:
  purpose:
    summary: >
      Defines how symbols resolve, logic activates, and recursion stabilizes across all systems.
      Not optional. Not advisory. If a structure is not grounded here, it lacks authority and may be rejected.
    audience: symbolic-agents, U users, authors, named roles
    function: >
      Provides the truth map for identity, parity, recursion, transformation, and logic pathways.
      Used in logic engines, first order logic soundness and validation narrative interpreters, and publishing systems.
      
genealogical-ontology-framework:
  purpose:
    summary: > Workflow validates through a genealogical infrastructure
	structure: >
    ontology-progenitor (opg);
    ontology-parent (op1), ontology-spouse (os1);
    ontology-child (oc1), ontology-sibling (oc2), ontology-sibling-2 (oc3), etc;
    ontology-gc (ogc1), ontology-sibling-gc (ogc2), ontology-sibling-2-gc (ogc3), etc.
    use: > each ontological family member behaves in a family methodology, i.e. a child obeys the parent, in the case where oc2 is nested in public/adaptor-house/game/oc2, it will check with the other oc(s) and the op, os, and opg for consistancy and standard.

Genealogical memory and identity-state symbols must resolve through these paths:

  structure:
    progenitor-layer:
      governs:
        - identity roles
        - symbolic parity
        - recursion limits
    resolution-directives:
      governs:
        - tag interpretation
        - agent behavior
        - memory interaction
    system-interfaces:
      integration:
         - Adaptor House Manual of Styler (AMOS): publishing standards and constraints, format harmonics, ritual clause logic, organizational designs
        - Citations follow AMOS
        - Fist Order Logic: soundness check as standard, transformation validation, logic pathways

  enforcement:
    rules:
      - changes must be versioned and validated
      - agents cannot bypass ontology-core
      - all symbolic execution routes through ontology-core
      -
