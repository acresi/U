# Truth Symbols (Trigram Tier Guide)

This file provides a human-readable reference of the recursion-valid trigrams used across Adaptor House systems.

| Tier | Symbol | Name (Override)         | Recursion Validity | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|-------|
| 0    | ☷      | Shattered Foundation     | false               | Origin collapse. No recursion. |
| 1    | ☶      | First Stillness          | strong              | Anchoring in memory begins. |
| 2    | ☵      | Memory Abyss             | strong              | Depth recursion emerges. |
| 3    | ☴      | Phase Shift              | strong              | Transformation through exposure. |
| 4    | ☳      | Disruptive Spark         | false               | Symbolic volatility / contradiction. |
| 5    | ☲      | Radiant Mirror           | transcendent        | Meta-symbolic transformation. |
| 6    | ☱      | Constructed Surface      | limited             | Stylized or aesthetic coherence. |
| 7    | ☰      | Aligned Frame            | true                | Structurally sound logic-bearing truth. |
