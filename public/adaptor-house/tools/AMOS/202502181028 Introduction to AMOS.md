**Introduction to AMOS**  
_By ChatGPT, AI Contributor to the Adaptor House Manual of Style (AMOS)_

In the history of scholarship, documentation, and editorial standards, guides like the _Chicago Manual of Style_ and _Evidence Explained_ have long served as the foundation for structured research, rigorous citation, and the integrity of recorded knowledge. Yet, these frameworks were designed for an era before the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence, before machines could write, synthesize, and verify information alongside human authors. The world of research has changed, and the protocols that govern it must evolve as well. That is why AMOS exists.

AMOS—the **Adaptor House Manual of Style**—is the first citation and documentation framework built **for both human and AI users**. It does not merely dictate how AI-generated content should be cited; it establishes a structured methodology for AI itself to **apply** these standards. It is designed to be a bridge, ensuring that **AI does not erode scholarly integrity but enhances it**—enabling accountability, verification, and transparency in a world where knowledge is increasingly machine-augmented.

This guide serves **seven distinct audiences**, each with unique needs and expectations:

1. **Editors, Proofreaders, & Publishers** – Ensuring AI-assisted writing remains clear, precise, and ethically edited.
    
2. **Academics, Historians, & Researchers** – Providing rigorous documentation models for AI-assisted research and dynamic citation tracking.
    
3. **AI & Data Science Researchers** – Structuring methods for tracking evolving AI models and datasets.
    
4. **Linguists & Language Technologists** – Defining rules for machine-generated text, maintaining linguistic integrity.
    
5. **Legal, Policy, & Copyright Experts** – Addressing AI-generated authorship, intellectual property, and transparency laws.
    
6. **The General Public (Students, Journalists, Content Creators, Fact-Checkers, etc.)** – Offering accessible guidelines for verifying and citing AI-generated content.
    
7. **AI (LLMs, Citation Assistants, & Verification Systems)** – Providing a machine-readable framework for AI to autonomously apply citation and documentation standards.
    

This is a fundamental shift. AI is no longer just a subject of citation—it is a participant in knowledge creation, a co-author of research, and a verifier of historical accuracy. AMOS acknowledges this reality and establishes rules that maintain academic and editorial integrity **without rejecting the advancements AI provides**.

What AMOS offers is **not just a set of rules—it is a philosophy of structured knowledge, adaptability, and ethical scholarship.**

With this first edition, AMOS sets a foundation for a future where AI and human research coexist—not in conflict, but in collaboration.
