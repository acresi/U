    - _‚ÄúYou‚Äôve come here to find yourself. But do you already know who you are?‚Äù_
    - **Options**:
        1. ‚ÄúYes, I know my Ego.‚Äù (Platform solidifies, glowing faintly.)

    - **Choice**:
        - "I am Defined"
        - "I am Seeking"

- **Technical Considerations**:
    - Ensure smooth transitions between the opening sequence and gameplay.
    - Optimize performance to handle dynamic environment changes based on player choices.
- **Narrative Integration**:
    - Align opening choices with overarching story arcs and character development.
