TROPED: MODEL MEMORY FILE

This document serves as a memory hook and symbolic logic anchor for the game Troped, a simplified OCG (Original Card Game) derived from the deeper system known as The Trope Machine. It is designed for use by GPT-based systems and logic-oriented assistants to maintain working context during gameplay generation, expansion, or runtime co-design.

SUMMARY

Title: Troped

Type: Original Card Game (OCG)

Parent System: The Trope Machine

Purpose: Symbolic, trope-based gameplay using logic-rich cards. Serves as a playable surface-level interface for deeper symbolic and narrative logic systems.

Design Goal: Simulate, surface, and manipulate narrative tropes through constrained, gameable form.

WORKING ASSUMPTIONS

Each card may represent a trope, archetype, or logic hook.

Gameplay likely centers on the combination, opposition, or recursion of tropes.

Rule mechanics may include: activation, inversion, recursion, mirroring, memory-state effects.

Alignment with fold_tropes.yaml structure is assumed.

Semantic compression is critical: 1 trope = symbolic payload.

GPT ENGINE BEHAVIOR INFERENCE

Use symbolic interpretation and memory-binding for trope references.

Maintain clarity between card-logic (Troped) and systemic logic (Trope Machine).

Preserve the autonomy of in-game tropes; they represent logic states, not just narrative.
