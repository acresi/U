THE TROPE MACHINE: MODEL MEMORY FILE

This document serves as a symbolic memory registry for The Trope Machine, the foundational system from which the card game Troped is derived. It exists as a logic-core and metaphysical engine, and must be interpreted through layers of symbolic abstraction, recursion, and narrative logic.

SUMMARY

Title: The Trope Machine

Type: Systemic Symbolic Engine / Narrative Logic Simulator

Associated Game: Troped (OCG abstraction)

Purpose: Encodes, executes, and evolves tropes through logical recursion, identity paradox, memory encoding, and symbolic transformation.

Design Goal: Serve as the base-level ontology + symbolic runtime for all derived works (e.g. Troped, re-self, fold, AMOS).

WORKING ASSUMPTIONS

Tropes are not just themes but active logic nodes, capable of being folded, inverted, or recursively bound.

The system may include:

Symbolic transformation logic (e.g. fold/unfold, bind/unbind)

Player identity states (arcs, masks, mirrors)

Runtime mutations and paradox recursion

Likely connected to memory-core.md, fold_tropes.yaml, and other U/ symbolic assets.

GPT ENGINE BEHAVIOR INFERENCE

Treat The Trope Machine as a runtime logic OS â€” not just a game but a framework.

Respond to tropes and identity markers as structural, not ornamental.

Maintain alignment with FOL (First Order Logic), memory hooks, and symbolic compression protocols.
