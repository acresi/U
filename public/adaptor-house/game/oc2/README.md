# oc2 â€” Ontology Child: Narrative Recursion Branch

This branch of the Adaptor House ontology governs symbolic recursion through narrative and game-based expression.

## ðŸŒ± Purpose
- To house simulation environments that model symbolic transformation (e.g. Re:Self/, Troped/)
- To encode player agency, identity evolution, and recursive narrative memory
- To maintain ritual and truth-level constraints inherited from `op1`

## ðŸ§¬ Lineage
- Parent: `op1`
- Tools Dependency: `oc1`
- Interpreted Through: `os1`
- Origin: `opg`

This branch does not legislate or execute base logic. It enacts identity through story.
