- trope_id: T2-0010
  trope_payoff: 2
  name: True Identity
  function: Psychological Inheritance
  description: A character's role becomes confused with their sense of self.
  phases:
    inherited: Role is accepted for survival or approval
    broken: Role becomes limiting, contradictory, or harmful
    transcended: Role is shed or re-contextualized into a higher truth
  affinities: [Tree, Vine, Crystal]
  resonance_level: High
  paradigm_shift_potential: Low
  associated_principles: [Reader as Origin, Story Must Risk Being Felt]
  resistance_cases:
    - Reader lacks symbolic literacy around roles
    - Cultures with fixed identity constructs
  text_out: Identity is the act of self and possession of awareness of self. This trope faces conflation or co-enactment of [T1-0010] character and [T1-0100] role. An individual must rely on [trope_id: T3-0010].
  depends_on:
    - T1-0010
    - T1-0100
  fulfills:
    - P05-Cultural Coherence

- trope_id: T3-0010
  trope_payoff: 3
  name: No Mask To Remove
  function: Psychological Inheritance
  description: A character has performed a role for so long it has replaced their identity.
  phases:
    inherited: The mask was once a tool for survival or success
    broken: The mask restricts self-awareness and causes psychological dissonance
    transcended: The mask is removed, ritualized, or weaponized with self-aware clarity
  affinities: [Parasite, Crystal, Vine]
  resonance_level: High
  paradigm_shift_potential: Medium
  associated_principles: [Reader as Origin, Story Must Risk Being Felt, Causality is the Engine of Meaning]
  resistance_cases:
    - Reader lacks cultural context for identity performance
    - Story fails to establish mask-to-self escalation
  text_out: When performance becomes the priority over identity, the individual must rely on [trope_id T2-0010].
  depends_on:
    - T2-0010
  triggers:
    - lccz:WitnessNode
  fulfills:
    - P07-ParadigmShift
