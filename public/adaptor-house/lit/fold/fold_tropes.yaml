  name: True Identity
  function: Psychological Inheritance
  description: >
    A character’s role becomes confused with their sense of self.
    The boundary between performance and being collapses.

    broken: Role becomes limiting, contradictory, or harmful.
    transcended: Role is shed or re-contextualized into a higher truth.

    - Tree
    - Vine
    - Crystal
  resonance_level: High
  paradigm_shift_potential: Low

    - Reader as Origin
    - Story Must Risk Being Felt
  resistance_cases:
    - Reader lacks symbolic literacy around roles.
    - Culture discourages identity reconstruction.
  text_out: >
    Identity is the act of self and the possession of awareness of self.

  name: No Mask To Remove
  function: Psychological Inheritance
  description: >
    A character has worn a role so long it becomes indistinguishable
    from their core identity—until rupture forces removal.
  phases:
    inherited: The mask was once a tool for survival or success.
    broken: The mask causes dissonance, restricting self-awareness.
    transcended: The mask is removed, ritualized, or weaponized with clarity.
  affinities:
    - Parasite
    - Crystal
    - Vine
  resonance_level: High
  paradigm_shift_potential: Medium
  associated_principles:
    - Reader as Origin
    - Story Must Risk Being Felt
    - Causality is the Engine of Meaning
  resistance_cases:
    - Reader lacks cultural context for identity performance.
    - Story fails to escalate mask-to-self inversion.
  text_out: >
    When performance becomes the priority over identity,
    the character must rely on T2-0010 to reclaim selfhood.
