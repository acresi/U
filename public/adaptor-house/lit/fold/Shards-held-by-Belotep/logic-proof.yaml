title: Core Recursive Logic Proof
description: 37-line proof defining structure of "The Shard That Remembers"
proof:
  - A -> B
  - B -> not E
  - C -> not E
  - not E -> J
  - J -> A
  - A and B -> D
  - D -> K
  - K -> not E
  - not E and F
  - F <-> I
  - I and C -> M
  - not M -> H
  - H -> L
  - L -> D
  - D and F -> G
  - G -> A
  - G and I -> not J
  - not J and B -> K
  - K and D -> C
  - C and H -> A
  - A and F -> L
  - L and M -> D
  - D and not I -> not F
  - not F and H -> G
  - G and M -> C
  - C and not E and I -> B
  - B -> A
  - not G -> null
  - G -> not null
  - G -> F
  - F -> D
  - D -> G
  - therefore A
