# FOLd (First-Order Logic Drafter)

A storytelling engine combining:
- Dynamic FOL backend modeling.
- Eight-Thesis narrative framework.
- Three-Lever adaptive changes.
- Multi-scalar Setup–Coherence–Payoff economy.
- Explicit Reader Involvement modeling.
- Live Validation Layer for quality assurance.

***Mission:*** Craft deeply logical, emotionally resonant, infinitely scalable stories.

**v1.3**
FOLd is a scalable storytelling engine that constructs narratives based on First-Order Logic (FOL), rather than intuition or template-driven structures.

It integrates formal proof structures, multi-scalar payoff economies, and dynamic reader involvement modeling to ensure:

Logical consistency from beats to arcs to acts

Emotionally resonant payoffs across micro and macro story scales

Scalability for infinite expansion without narrative corruption

**Core Components**
Eight Core Theses: World, Timeframe, Culture, Mythos, Characters, Story Structure, Payoff Economy, Reader Involvement.

Dynamic FOL Operations: Setup, Coherence, Payoff, Foreshadow, Linking, Driving, Engaging — all formally modeled at every narrative scale.

Payoff Economy: Distributed emotional payoffs across beats, scenes, chapters, arcs, with optional explicit final destinations.

Reader Model: Tracks tension, curiosity, immersion, revisitability dynamically through every stage.

Proof Structure System: Validates premises and arguments (e.g., Reluctant Hero ➔ Chosen One) through formal logic.
 - where a premise or premiss is a proposition: a true or false declarative statement. 
 - used in an argument to prove the truth of another proposition called the conclusion or qed (the therefore).
 - Arguments consist of a set of premises, and formally a conclusion.

Validation Layer: Audits all seeds, coherence, payoffs, and reader engagement for narrative integrity.

Manifest-Linked: Fully organized under manifest.json for modular, automation-ready loading.

**Key Innovations**

Feature	What It Solves
FOL-Driven Narratives	Prevents emotional or logical inconsistencies common in intuitive writing.
Multi-Scale Payoff Tracking	Ensures micro-resolutions support larger emotional stakes.
Formal Proof Structures	Validates narrative transformations with logical rigor, not just emotional assumptions.
Manifest Registration	Allows FOLd to operate as a self-contained, loadable storytelling OS.
Conclusion Management  Withholding or delaying the conclusion by placing a temporary setup/payoff FOLd creates innovative storytelling.

Purpose
FOLd exists to build stories that are logical in their structure, deep in their emotion, scalable in their expansion, and unforgettable in their impact.
