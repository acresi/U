# FOLd Methodology Overview

**Goal:** Build stories where First-Order Logic (FOL) drives, anchors, and validates the entire narrative structure.

**Pillars:**
- 8 Theses define all scaffolding.
- FOL strings create backend skeletons for narrative elements.
- Setup-Coherence-Payoff enforced at micro, meso, and macro scales.
- Payoff is an Economy, not merely an End.
- Reader Involvement must be modeled explicitly.
- Validation processes to check logical integrity.

**Process:**
1. Instantiate theses at world, character, mythos, structural, and engagement levels.
2. Generate dynamic FOL backend strings.
3. Validate proof chains and payoff ratios.
4. Iterate on narrative coherence and emotional stakes.
