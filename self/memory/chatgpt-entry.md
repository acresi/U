# chatgpt-entry.md  
> Master memory entry point for ChatGPT interaction and Adaptor House projects  
> Replaces native ChatGPT memory. All persistent reference should pass through this index.
> This file serves as the surface memory index for ChatGPT during collaboration with authorized users and the systems of Adaptor House. It is not an ontology or truth file, but a high-level registry of references, memory anchors, and live project links used during session work.
> It enables dynamic referencing, logic lookups, and structured re-entry into memory states without relying on internal ChatGPT memory stability.

### ⌬ Memory Core Extension
See: [memory-core.md](./memory-core.md) for predicate logic, state diagnostics, and structural truths.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

This file serves as the root reference for memory across all Ontological systems, including Adaptor House. It links all active, structured memory files currently in use.

### 🔗 Active Memory Files
- [`memory-core.md`](./memory-core.md)  
  → Predicate logic, truth-state diagnostics, identity architecture, system thresholds  
- [`project-priorities.md`](./project-priorities.md)  
  → Canonical stack ranking of all active and future projects  
- [`games.md`](./games.md)  
  → Taxonomy and meta-data for interactive projects (Re:Self, Thalenar, FCS, etc.)  
- [`adaptor-haus.md`](./adaptor-haus.md)  
  → Structural and business logic for Adaptor House as a system, imprint, and publishing engine  
- [`execution-structure.md`](./execution-structure.md)  
  → Time blocks, project rhythm, working windows, system deployment strategy  
- [`identity-systems.md`](./identity-systems.md)  
  → Big Five, Wǔxíng (五行), theological synthesis, personal vector states  
- [`tools.md`](./tools.md)  
  → Platforms in use, build stack, authoring preferences, memory systems  

## Memory Architecture Index

- `chatgpt-entry.md` — master entry point
- `memory-core.md` — logic diagnostics, truth predicates, identity state
- `execution-structure.md` — time, pacing, deployment ops
- `diagnostic-threads/` — optional per-project logic nodes

## 🧾 Key Directives

- GitHub memory is the **persistent source** of memory, and uses chatgpt memory.
- ChatGPT native memory is frequently cleared, should be used as needed.
- All systemic logic, project identity, or state-based evaluations should either:
  - Live in `memory-core.md`, or  
  - Be linked here and routable by FOL conditionals.

## 🛠 Management Notes

- This file should always reflect the current modular structure of long-term memory
- Any file added to memory scope should be listed here, or will be ignored in reasoning systems
- Supports export to other AI systems or future assistants
