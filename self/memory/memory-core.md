# memory-core.md

> “This memory is a boundary between clarity and entropy.”

## 🧱 Purpose
U is not just a project—it is a persistent internal structure for thought, creation, and organization. This memory-core serves as a foundation to track, curate, and evolve all subdomains of my work.

---

## 📁 Core Memory Layout

- `self/` → Internal systems, identity, origin, philosophy, beliefs  
- `public/` → Work intended for publication, collaboration, or reference  
- `adaptor-haus/` → Publishing infrastructure, style guides, development protocols  
- `identity-systems/` → Projects like Life Architect, FOLd  
- `memory/` → Meta-mapping and indexation  
- `meta/` → Philosophy of U, versioning principles, laws of structure

## 🧭 Navigation Philosophy

- Memory is **curated, not dumped**.  
- Each `.md` is a point of entry, not just a file.  
- **Versioned growth** over entropy: tracked changes are identity-building.
