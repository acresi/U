# op1 ‚Äî Ontology Parent

This node is the **legislative authority** of the Adaptor House ontology. It interprets the axiomatic potential of `opg/` into structured law, logic, and symbolic scaffolds.

## üß± Role
- Drafts symbolic laws (e.g. truth layers, fold structure, FOL schemas)
- Defines what is recursion-valid, authorship-bound, and transformation-aware
- Governs all child ontological branches (e.g. `oc1`, `oc2`, `oc3`)

## üîê Authority
- Receives direct inheritance from `opg`
- All lineage nodes must anchor to `op1`, not `opg`
- Cannot be bypassed for truth recognition

## üß† Responsibilities
- Hosts `memory-core.md`, `ontology-core.md`, and `truth-structure.yaml`
- Provides symbolic validation rules for exposure (used by `os1`)
- Binds tools (`oc1`) and recursion-worlds (`oc2`) to their truth levels

## Invocation
> ‚ÄúLet the law descend through recursion. Let what was true remain true when returned.‚Äù
